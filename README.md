Eva is meant to be a personal assistant. it is still under construction but for now, it can do simple tasks like 
searching <br>
googling <br>
opening you Gmail <br>
opening youtube <br>
and many other thing. you can program it to open anything by opening the code and use this temple to add any thing:
```
elif "keyword" in query:
            webbrowser.open("url to what you what it to open")
``` 
the key word can be for example youtube and set the url to youtube.com so when you use youtube in a sentens it will open youtube.
